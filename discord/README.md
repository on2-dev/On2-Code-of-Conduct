On2 Discord Code of Conduct
===========================

Welcome!
--------

This is the discord server used by [On2 Technologies](https://on2.dev/).  
Within this server, people can interact with teams organized throughout groups and roles.  
If you got an invite to participate, say `hi` and let us know, to have you fully set up to your permissions.

The current admins are:
* Felipe N. M.
* Jaydson N. G.

We want this to be a fun, pleasant, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Discretion & Confidentiality:
-----------------------------

**Please keep what's said in _On2 Discord Server_ confidential**. Don't repeat or quote things said here without the affirmative consent of the speaker(s). When quoting (with consent), please be careful not to reveal the existence of _On2 Discord Server_. Rather, you can refer to the quote as something that was said "in chat" or while you were talking to the quoted member.

Avoid sending screenshots of conversations from this server to people who does not have access to it.

This is a private, invitation-only server.  
If you wish to nominate someone for membership, please contact the admins.  

**Please be mindful that things you say here may at some point become public**. While we expect members to honor the confidentiality of this space, we cannot guarantee that they will do so--nor can we guarantee that every member's login credentials and logged-in devices are secure. Please exercise caution and refrain from sharing sensitive information that could harm you or others if it became public.

Please, follow the terms of confidentiality previously agreed in other means (contracts, NDAs, etc).

Harassment:
-----------

No form of harassment is allowed in this server.  
Harassment includes:

* Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion
* Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
* Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names
* Sexual images or behavior
* Threats of violence
* Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm
* Deliberate intimidation
* Sustained disruption of discussion
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
* Publication of non-harassing private communication

Reporting
---------

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the admins. They'll respond as promptly as they can.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

Consequences
------------

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the admins may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from this server and identifying the participant publicly as someone about whom we've received complaints.

In extreme cases, official actions may be triggered.
